Math Painting

🚧 Work in Progress 🚧

This project is still in development, but it is functional for creating an image canvas with user-defined geometrical shapes such as squares and rectangles. Expect some refinements and potential improvements in future versions.

📌 Overview

Math Painting is a Python application that allows users to input coordinates, dimensions, and colors to generate an image file with drawn geometrical shapes.

⚙️ Features

Create a canvas with custom dimensions and background color

Draw squares and rectangles with user-specified properties

Save the final image as a PNG file

🚀 Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

Pip (Python package manager)

Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required libraries:

pip install numpy pillow

Run the Application

python main.py

🛠 Known Issues

Input validation is minimal; incorrect inputs may cause errors.

Shapes drawn outside the canvas boundaries will not be visible.

Currently only supports squares and rectangles.

📌 Future Improvements

Add support for more shapes (circles, triangles, etc.).

Implement better input validation and error handling.

Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier shape placement.
