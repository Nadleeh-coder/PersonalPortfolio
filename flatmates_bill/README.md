Flatmates Bill

🚧 Work in Progress 🚧

This project is a simple Python script that calculates the bill share for two flatmates based on the number of days they stayed in the flat during a given billing period. Additionally, it generates a PDF report with the calculated amounts.

📌 Overview

Flatmates Bill is a Python-based cost-sharing tool that takes in:

The total bill amount.

The billing period.

The number of days each flatmate stayed in the flat.

It then computes how much each person has to pay and generates a PDF report.

⚙️ Features

✅ Calculate the fair share of the bill based on the number of days stayed.
✅ Generate a PDF report with the details.
✅ Simple and lightweight script.
